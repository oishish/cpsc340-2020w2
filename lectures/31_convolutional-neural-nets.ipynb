    "  - People like to go back and check their work.\n",

    "  - People with more crowded exam schedules feel at more of a disadvantage with no time limit.\n",
    "  - People feel like the midterm was too time-limited. Furthermore parsing the questions takes longer for certain students like non-native English speakers.\n",
    "- Cheating is slightly easier with 100 minutes than 65 minutes, but it's worth it.\n",
