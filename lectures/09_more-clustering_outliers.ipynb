Thus, the outliers we're concerned with so far are in the features (X-values). Next week we'll start on regression, and that opens up a new can of worms, namely outliers in the y-values.  The methods from today do apply to looking at the y-values, but there are also some new approaches specifically to deal with these outliers in the y-values. The week after next we'll discuss one of them."
